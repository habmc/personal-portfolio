# personal-portfolio
I made this website when I first learned about HTML and CSS. Since I was not familiar with JavaScript at that time, this personal portfolio was coded entirely by HTML and CSS. No fancy stuffs there, but there is always the first time yk.

You can take a look at the website by this link: https://codepen.io/habmc/full/qBWLKdY
