I made this website when I first learned about HTML and CSS and recently updated it with some new info. Since I was not familiar with JavaScript at the time I made this, it was created entirely by HTML and CSS. No fancy stuffs there, but there is always the first time yk.

You can take a look at the website by this link: https://codepen.io/habmc/full/qBWLKdY
